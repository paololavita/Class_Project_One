Co-Op Attendance

README

Overview

A co-op instructor wants keep a database of students attending their co-op at various locations throughout a city or town. Normally the co-op instructor would have print several copies of a form and write down the details of each student eg: student name, age, co-op business etc. Then the instructor would visit the co-op business and verify the students attendance on a daily basis.

Solution

We would create a website that would save the database online and allow the instructor to use a device to enter the information about the student and their co-op. Then all the instructor is visit the co-op in question and verify the students attendance.

Co-Op Attendance

The website created allows the user to enter the student information via the Attendance entry fields. (see fig 1)

Fig 1: Information entered here will include Student Name, Address, the date the student starts ths co-op and the time they showed up at.

There is a multiple choice radio buttons set up to be checked if the student arrives on time, late or is absent.

Once fields have been filled out the corresponding data will populate the Student Information database. The data entered here will allow the instructor to keep track of each students attendance at the co-op. (see Fig 2)

Fig 2: The red box surrounding the map map area will link to the google maps api and display the location of the co-op the student is attending.
